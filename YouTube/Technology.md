### 1. **Web Development Fundamentals**

- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling your web pages.
- **JavaScript**: For client-side interactivity.

  ### 1. **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**

  HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages. Here are the key concepts to focus on:


  - **Basic Structure**: Understand the basic structure of an HTML document, including `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
  - **Elements and Tags**: Learn about common HTML elements such as headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), links (`<a>`), images (`<img>`), lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`), and forms (`<form>`, `<input>`, `<button>`).
  - **Attributes**: Understand how to use attributes to provide additional information about elements (e.g., `src`, `href`, `alt`, `class`, `id`).
  - **Semantic HTML**: Learn about semantic elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<nav>` to improve accessibility and SEO.

    ### 1. **Basic Structure of an HTML Document**

    Every HTML document has a basic structure. Hereâ€™s a simple example:


    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>My First HTML Page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
        <p>This is my first paragraph of text.</p>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

    ### Key Components:

    - `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type and version of HTML.
    - `<html>`: The root element of the HTML document.
    - `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the document (e.g., title, character set).
    - `<body>`: Contains the content of the document that is displayed in the browser.

    ### 2. **Common HTML Elements**

    Here are some essential HTML elements you should know:

    - **Headings**: Used to define headings. There are six levels of headings.

      ```html
      <h1>This is a Heading 1</h1>
      <h2>This is a Heading 2</h2>
      <h3>This is a Heading 3</h3>
      ```
    - **Paragraphs**: Used to define blocks of text.

      ```html
      <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
      ```
    - **Links**: Used to create hyperlinks.

      ```html
      <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>
      ```
    - **Images**: Used to embed images.

      ```html
      <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of image">
      ```
    - **Lists**: Used to create ordered and unordered lists.

      ```html
      <ul>
          <li>Item 1</li>
          <li>Item 2</li>
      </ul>

      <ol>
          <li>First Item</li>
          <li>Second Item</li>
      </ol>
      ```
    - **Forms**: Used to collect user input.

      ```html
      <form action="/submit" method="post">
          <label for="name">Name:</label>
          <input type="text" id="name" name="name">
          <input type="submit" value="Submit">
      </form>
      ```

    ### 3. **Attributes**

    HTML elements can have attributes that provide additional information. Common attributes include:

    - `id`: A unique identifier for an element.
    - `class`: A class name for styling.
    - `src`: The source of an image or video.
    - `href`: The URL for a link.
    - `alt`: Alternative text for images.

    Example:

    ```html
    <img src="logo.png" alt="Company Logo" class="logo">
    ```

    ### 4. **Semantic HTML**

    Using semantic HTML elements improves accessibility and SEO. Here are some semantic elements:

    - `<header>`: Represents introductory content or navigational links.
    - `<footer>`: Represents footer content.
    - `<article>`: Represents a self-contained composition.
    - `<section>`: Represents a thematic grouping of content.
    - `<nav>`: Represents navigation links.

    Example:

    ```html
    <header>
        <h1>My Website</h1>
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
                <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </header>
    ```

    ### 5. **Practice**

    To practice HTML, try creating a simple webpage with the following elements:

    - A title and headings.
    - A paragraph of text.
    - An image with an alt attribute.
    - A list of your favorite movies or books.
    - A link to your favorite website.
    - A simple form with a text input and a submit button.
